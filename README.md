# Tom & Jerry - Text-based Adventure Game

A) Introduction:
    This game is based on the animated series Tom & Jerry (1940-1969). You 
    follow the rivalry between a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. This 
    game requires humor and the ability to handle a bit of violence. However, 
    know that no animals were harmed during the creation of this game and 
    even your most violent choice will not cause the characters to shed blood! 
    Depending on the character you choose, your goal of the game will change; 
    so, choose wisely!
    
    Level 1: Choose your character
    Level 2: Move to a room in the house
    Level 3: Tom or Jerry create a strategy 
    Level 4: Tom and Jerry's traps and tricks
